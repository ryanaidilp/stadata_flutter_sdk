# Try the Example

You can explore the capabilities of the Stadata Flutter SDK by checking out the example app provided in the [SDK's GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryanaidilp/stadata_flutter_sdk/tree/main/app/example).

To run the example app and see the SDK in action, follow these steps:

1. Create an .env file in the example directory or copy it from .env.example:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Copy your `API_KEY` to the .env file:

   ```dotenv
   API_KEY=  # Put your API Key here
   ```

3. Generate `env.g.dart` by running the following command in the example directory:

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build -d
   ```

   If the build is successful, it will generate the necessary code.

4. Run the example app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
