## Installation

**‚ùó In order to start using Stadata Flutter Sdk you must have the [Flutter SDK][flutter_install_link] installed on your machine.**

**Step 1:** Add `stadata_flutter_sdk` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stadata_flutter_sdk:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/ryanaidilp/stadata_flutter_sdk.git
      ref: main
```

**Step 2:** Install the package:

```sh
flutter packages get
```

**Step 3:** Get your API Key:

Visit [https://webapi.bps.go.id/](https://webapi.bps.go.id/) to obtain your API Key.

**Step 4:** Initialize the SDK:

Inside your `main.dart` file, add the following code to initialize the SDK with your API Key:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await StadataFlutter.instance.init(
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY', // Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API Key
  );
}
```

**Step 5:** Try the Example:

You can explore the SDK by checking out the [example](https://github.com/ryanaidilp/stadata_flutter_sdk/tree/develop/example). To run the example app, follow these steps:

- Create an `.env` file in the `example` directory or copy it from `.env.example`:

  ```sh
  cp .env.example .env
  ```

- Copy your `API_KEY` to `.env` file

  ```env
  API_KEY=  #Put your API Key here
  ```

- Generate `env.g.dart` by running the following command:

  ```sh
  dart run build_runner build -d
  ```

- If the build is successful, you can run the example app:

  ```sh
  flutter run
  ```

Now, you're ready to explore the capabilities of `stadata_flutter_sdk` in your Flutter application.

## Usage

The BPS Web API provides two main types of data: "list" and "view." Each type serves different purposes, and here's a guide on how to use them.

### List

The `list` method returns a `ListResult` class, which includes two main properties:

1. **Data Property:**
   - The `data` property contains a list of data based on the specified type. For instance, if you are fetching publications, the data will be of type `List<Publication>`.
2. **Pagination Property:**
   - The `pagination` property is an instance of the `Pagination` entity, which provides information related to pagination. It includes the following properties:
     - `page`: The current page.
     - `pages`: The total number of pages.
     - `count`: The count of data entries on the current page.
     - `perPage`: The number of entries per page.
     - `total`: The total number of data entries.

To retrieve a list of models, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of `StadataFlutter`.

2. Access the `list` getter from the instance, granting you access to various models from domains, publications, press releases, and more.

3. Use the `list` method with the desired parameters. For example:

```dart
var result = await StadataFlutter.instance.list.publications(domain: '7200');
```

This call will provide you with a `ListResult` containing data of type `List<Publication>` and pagination information for further navigation.

### View

In addition to the `list` property, `StadataFlutter` also provides the `view` property, which allows you to retrieve detailed information about a specific model. For instance, if you want to view the details of a publication, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Instance of StadataFlutter:**

   - Begin by creating an instance of `StadataFlutter`.

2. **Access the `view` Getter:**

   - Access the `view` getter from the instance, granting you access to different models from domains, publications, press releases, and more.

3. **Use the `view` Method with Required Parameters:**
   - Utilize the `view` method, specifying the required parameters. For example:

```dart
var result = await StadataFlutter.instance.view.publication(
  id: 'a78f4d4f1c3548600cffcd29',
  domain: '7200'
);
```

By following these steps, you can seamlessly retrieve detailed information about specific models using the BPS Web API. Whether you need to access lists or in-depth details, `StadataFlutter` provides the tools to help you accomplish your goals efficiently.

### Enums for Simplified API Requests and Response Handling

Within the `StadataFlutter` SDK, you'll find several enums designed to streamline API requests and facilitate the handling of API responses.

**1. DataLanguage Enum:**

- The `DataLanguage` enum is used to specify the language parameter when making API requests. It offers two options:
  - `DataLanguage.id`: Represents the Indonesian language.
  - `DataLanguage.en`: Represents the English language.

**2. DomainType Enum:**

- The `DomainType` enum simplifies domain type parameters for domain models in API requests. It includes the following options:
  - `DomainType.all`: Retrieve all domains, including provinces and regencies.
  - `DomainType.province`: Retrieve all province domains.
  - `DomainType.regency`: Retrieve all regency domains.
  - `DomainType.regencyByProvince`: Retrieve all regency domains within a specified province ID.

**3. DataAvailability Enum:**

- The `DataAvailability` enum helps you check the `data-availability` key in API responses, making it easier to determine the availability of data. It includes the following options:
  - `DataAvailability.available`: Indicates that data is available.
  - `DataAvailability.listNotAvailable`: Indicates that the list is not available.
  - `DataAvailability.notAvailable`: Indicates that data is not available.

These enums serve as valuable tools to enhance the readability and manageability of your API-related code. Whether you're specifying language preferences, domain types, or checking data availability, these enums simplify the process and make your code more concise and expressive.

## Continuous Integration

Stadata Flutter Sdk comes with a built-in [GitHub Actions workflow][github_actions_link] powered by [Very Good Workflows][very_good_workflows_link] but you can also add your preferred CI/CD solution.

Out of the box, on each pull request and push, the CI `formats`, `lints`, and `tests` the code. This ensures the code remains consistent and behaves correctly as you add functionality or make changes. The project uses [Very Good Analysis][very_good_analysis_link] for a strict set of analysis options used by our team. Code coverage is enforced using the [Very Good Workflows][very_good_coverage_link].
