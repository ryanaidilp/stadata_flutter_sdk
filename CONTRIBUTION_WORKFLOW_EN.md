| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Backlog**      | Feature/bug not yet scheduled or still an idea.    | "Add dark mode"              |
| **Ready**        | Task has been prioritized and is ready to work on. | "Fix typo in README"         |
| **In Progress**  | Developer is currently working on the task.        | "Implement API endpoint"     |
| **Open PR**      | Implementation done, PR is opened.                 | "PR #42: Add search feature" |
| **In Review**    | PR is being reviewed by codeowner/maintainer.      | "Review by @maintainer"      |

  A[Backlog üóÇÔ∏è] --> B[Ready ‚úÖ]
  B --> C[In Progress üîß]
  C --> D[Open Pull Request üîÅ]
  D --> E[In Review üëÄ]
  E --> F{Need Changes?}
  F -- Yes --> C
  F -- No --> G{PR Merged or Closed?}
  G -- Yes --> H[Done üéâ]
  G -- No --> E
```

**Explanation:**  
Each task starts from Backlog, moves to Ready, is worked on (In Progress), then a PR is opened. After review, if revisions are needed it goes back to In Progress, if approved and merged, the status becomes Done.
