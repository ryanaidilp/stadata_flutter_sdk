/// Entity class representing derived/grouped time periods from BPS Web API.
///
/// This class maps to the derived periods endpoint:
/// `https://webapi.bps.go.id/v1/api/list?model=turth`
///
/// Derived periods (turth) represent calculated or transformed time periodsâ€”
/// aggregations or groupings across base periods. Unlike standard periods (th)
/// which represent individual years, derived periods offer grouped temporal
/// categories for more complex time-based analysis.
///
/// Derived periods enable users to:
/// - Access pre-aggregated temporal groupings (e.g., "Tahunan" for annual)
/// - Query multi-period calculations and transformations
/// - Analyze data across custom time ranges
/// - Utilize standardized temporal classifications
///
/// Each derived period includes:
/// - A unique identifier for the derived calculation
/// - A display label describing the temporal grouping
/// - Group classification metadata for organizing related periods
///
/// Derived periods work alongside base periods (th), variables, and vertical
/// variables to form the complete dimensional structure for dynamic table queries.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// // Get available derived periods for a variable
/// final derivedPeriods = await stadata.list.derivedPeriods(
///   domain: '0000',
///   variableID: 145,
/// );
///
/// // Use in dynamic table query for aggregated data
/// final data = await stadata.view.dynamicTableData(
///   domain: '0000',
///   variableID: 145,
///   derivedPeriodID: derivedPeriods.data.first.id,
/// );
/// ```
